OBTAINING INSIGHTS INTO HOW INTERMITTENT FASTING AFFECTS PEOPLE WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES THROUGH  INTERACTIVE VISUAL DASHBOARDS

                    <p align="left" ><b> <font color="green">Introduction: </font> </b>I present this interactive summary webpage intended to introduce basic knowledge and awareness to people with diabetes to motivate themselves to reverse diabetes.  This tool can also be used by anyone who wants to explore on diabetes statics,how to reverse diabetes and will also focus on giving users a required glimpse of diabetes reversal through intermittent fasting.The data visualizations are created using Tableau and D3.js. The interactive visualizations are build using D3.js along with JavaScript. The UI is created using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery libraries and Bootstrap.  
                    </p>
                    <p align="left"> <b> <font color="blue"> Home Tab: </font> </b> The data set used for this exploration is "Saumya Agarwal, “Healthcare Data” , “https://www.kaggle.com/asaumya/healthcare-data, April 16,2018", which has information on several diabetic adults’ average glucose level and BMI with different categories of people such as resident type, gender, and work type.  I used the average aggregate function to calculate the average glucose level as this data set has more than 100 records. This visualization clearly implies that working male and female has higher glucose levels after a meal than others.</p>
                    </p>
                    <p align="left"> <b> <font color="blue"> Search Statistics Tab:</font> </b>  The data set used here is Google news lab, “Health Searches by US Metropolitan Area, 2005- 2017“, https://www.kaggle.com/GoogleNewsLab/health-searches-us-county , November 3, 2017. I cleaned the dataset to have only diabetes interest in various cities in the USA to explore about how many people searched about diabetes.To narrow down the search to see how many people in the cities of California and particularly in 2004, 2010 and 2017 searched for diabetes and used the side by side bar chart and this is self-explanatory. Obviously, number of people searched about diabetes increases over years as we are aware that populations and internet connections might have also increased as shown in the bar chart.  </p>
					<p align="left"> <b> <font color="blue"> Type2Diabetes Statistics Tab: </font> </b> The data set used for these visualizations are http://ncdrisc.org/data-downloads-diabetes.html, https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/adults-with-diabetes-per-100-lghc-indicator-23 These figures indicate that number of adults diagnosed with diabetes increased over year and in 1980 more number of women had diabetes over men, in 1996 equal number of men and women had diabetes and in 2014 the trend changed that more number of men had diabetes over women. We can clearly see them in the line chart than in the area chart.Also user can use the interactions to explore statistics about the adults with type 2 diabetes in CA, USA using year and category filters </p>

					Type2Diabetes Reversal Tab: </font> </b> A collapsible tree visualization using D3.js will show the users the options about proven methods of reversing diabetes based on the data from  Anchan, Anitha. "Have You Heard About Diabetes Reversal?" Diabetes (2019)., and Kathleen Doheny,” Lose Weight, Reverse Type 2 Diabetes: Why It Works”,

					<p align="left"> <b> <font color="blue"> 6vs2 Tab: </font> </b> . A user can easily infer from this dashboard that the people’s waist circumference and average fasting glucose has decreased after they practiced taking two meals per day. Hence the user can understand from this study easily that the intermittent fasting might help to reduce/control diabetes.DataSet from: Kahleova, Hana, et al. "Eating two larger meals a day (breakfast and lunch) is more effective than six smaller meals in a reduced-energy regimen for patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomised crossover study." Diabetologia 57.8 (2014): 1552-1560.      </p>
					<p align="left"> <b> <font color="blue"> Intermittent Fasting Tab: </font> </b> This study took ten participants with T2DM and they were all taking metformin, and on average were obese [mean body mass index (BMI) 36.90 kg/m2]. They all followed a standard diet in first 2 weeks of phase 1, then followed an intermittent fasting for about 18 to 20 hours for 2 weeks in phase 2 and again standard diet for another 2 weeks in Phase 3. We can see that a short-term period of IF in a small group of individuals with T2DM led to significant group decreases in weight (-1.395 kg, P = 0.009), BMI (-0.517, P = 0.013), and at-target morning glucose (SMBG). DataSet used : Arnason, Terra G et al. “Effects of intermittent fasting on health markers in those with type 2 diabetes: A pilot study.” World journal of diabetes vol. 8,4 (2017): 154-164. doi:10.4239/wjd.v8.i4.154</p>
					<p align="left"> <b> <font color="blue"> HbA1C Tab: </font> </b> , This is  an interactive visualization using D3.js with tool tip and radio buttons to choose patients and the line chart to show the hbA1c and waist circumferences before and after intermittent fasting. To match with the hbA1c scale I converted the waist circumference values to decimeter instead of inches. Below screenshots shows the code snippets and visualizations.   Users will get an insight on how intermittent fasting helped the patients to reduce the hbA1c and waist circumferences. Data set used here is Furmli, Suleiman, et al. "Therapeutic use of intermittent fasting for people with type 2 diabetes as an alternative to insulin." Case Reports 2018 (2018): bcr-2017.  </p>
